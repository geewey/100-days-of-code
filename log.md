# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox as another platform to explore commands in the terminal.

**Thoughts:** Having the right tools is important. Meaning, running VirtualBox on MacBook Air with 8gb ram may not be the wisest choice.

### Day 2: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisited previous Meditation App project. Began addressing security vulnerabilities for Ruby on Rails backend.

**Thoughts**: I learned about GitHub's automated security updates. This really highlights the importance of version control and automated testing.

### Day 3: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to launch Meditation App project, only to discover a previous PostgreSQL update has caused a conflict with version control. Spent some time to scope out the problem but did not identify any immediate or quick fixes.

**Thoughts**: Beware of global installs. Side effects include broken projects. I appreciate this as a good chance to deepen my PostgreSQL understanding.

### Day 4: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Researching PostgreSQL database conflicts. Gathering potential fixes to attempt tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Trying to sort out if it's as simple as storing user and password data in environment variables, or if there are other complications.

### Day 5: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discussed a previous project during tonight's MeetUp, which gave me ideas for refactoring but no time for PostgreSQL investigation.

**Thoughts**: Focused coding activities should occur before 10pm, or else I run into the risk where it is de-prioritized.
