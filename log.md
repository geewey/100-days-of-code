# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox as another platform to explore commands in the terminal.

**Thoughts:** Having the right tools is important. Meaning, running VirtualBox on MacBook Air with 8gb ram may not be the wisest choice.

### Day 2: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisited previous Meditation App project. Began addressing security vulnerabilities for Ruby on Rails backend.

**Thoughts**: I learned about GitHub's automated security updates. This really highlights the importance of version control and automated testing.
